Add DTO 
Implement a validation for every TDO 
new standard testing with benchmark 
use pgx instead of gorm 
use one query always (detect not found errors and already exist error by searching string example(strings.contain(err,"now rows")))


use this approach instead of using dependency injection packages 
var (
	UserService userService = userService{}
)

type userService struct {
}
